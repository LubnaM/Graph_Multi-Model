# Graph_Multi-Model
Dynamic Graph Multi-Model
Project Overview

This project explores new graph multi-model approach for uncovering Parkinsonâ€™s disease stages  using proteomic data, specifically focusing on peptides and their abundance patterns across patients. The goal is to:

1) Assess existing feature representation algorithim performance in corresponding to the novel developped multimodel

3) Uncover temporal PD disease stages through disease development.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset used is from the AMP Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Progression Prediction
